				<h2>I am...</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A full-stack web developer with over nine years of experience focusing on web applications built using modern frameworks like Angular and React.
					</li>
					<li>
						A student at <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a> studying <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">Computer Science</a>. Northeastern offers a five year program, which I am in my third year of. The university is also known for their cooperative education program, which I have participated in.
					</li>
					<li>
						An occasional freelance developer.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>I have worked at...</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Compete, Inc</u> as an intern full-stack web developer for six months as  part of the cooperative education (co-op) program at Northeastern. I was responsible for maintaining and upgrading extensive front-end user interface code and was one of two developers working on a separate new product.</li>
					<li><u>Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research</u> as a front-end web developer for nearly eight months from May to December 2012. I worked to develop large internal web applications for Novartis scientists to better keep track and record their research.</li>
					<li><u>PayPal (eBay, Inc)</u> where I developed an AngularJS application that made it easier for PayPal employees to manage and create merchant coupon offers. I also worked on another Java Spring application that allowed merchants to create retail offers. I worked in a small team in PayPal's Boston office that was a recently acquired startup.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>I'm currently working at</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><u>HourlyNerd (eBay, Inc)</u> since January 2015 helping build their enterprise business consulting application. I have been instrumental in designing the frontend Angular application and a few major architecture upgrades in the last few months.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>My Projects</h2>
				<p>
					I have been interested in randomized mapping algorithms for several years. This involves randomly generating terrain features that resemble a geological world map. I have expanded this further to feature temperature, rainfall, lakes and rivers, climate zones, and even plate tectonics. Most of my current work is randomly generating political boundaries on these random worlds.
				</p>

				<p>
					My main project of five years is a web-based space strategy game that implements many of the map generation techniques I've discovered over the years. The backend of the game is written in Python using the Flask framework with the frontend being in Angular with many canvas components.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Other interests include...
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Starting side projects I never finish.
					</li>
					<li>
						Writing science fiction short stories. A small hobby of mine that originally started with writing a backstory for my game project.
					</li>
					<li>
						Strategy games. A passion that sparked my interest in computer science and inspired me to build something similar.
					</li>
				</ul>
