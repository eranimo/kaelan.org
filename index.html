				<h2>I am...</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A full-stack web developer with over six years of experience focusing on web 
					applications built using modern MVC frameworks such as Ember.js and Backbone.js.
					</li>
					<li>A student at <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern 
					University</a> studying <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">Computer Science</a>. 
					Northeastern offers a five year program, which I am in my third year of. The university 
					is also known for their cooperative education program, which I have participated 
					in.</li>
					<li>An occasional freelance developer.</li>
					<li>A recovering PHP developer of four years. The recent explosion of interest 
					in Javascript led to a reinventing of my skillset.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>I have worked at...</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Compete, Inc</u> as an intern full-stack web developer for six months as 
					part of the cooperative education (co-op) program at Northeastern. I was responsible 
					for maintaining and upgrading extensive front-end user interface code and was one of 
					two developers working on a separate new product.</li>
					<li><u>Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research</u> as a front-end web developer
					for nearly eight months from May to December 2012. I worked to develop large internal 
					web applications for Novartis scientists to better keep track and record their research.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>My Projects</h2>
				<p>
				I have been interested in randomized mapping algorithms for several years. This 
				involves randomly generating terrain features that resemble a geological world map. I have 
				expanded this further to feature temperature, rainfall, lakes and rivers, climate zones, 
				and even plate tectonics. Most of my current work is randomly generating political 
				boundaries on these random worlds.
				</p>

				<p>
				My main project of five years is, in its current iteration, a webapp/game written in Node.js 
				using websockets for communication and MongoDB for storage. The frontend of game is handled 
				with Ember.js and uses HTML5 Canvas elements extensively. Its often used as a playground for 
				testing the newest Javascript or database software craze.
				</p>

				<h2>Other interests include...</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Writing science fiction short stories. A small hobby of mine that originally 
					started with writing a backstory for my game project.</li>
					<li>Strategy games. A passion that sparked my interest in computer science and 
					inspired me to build something similar.</li>
				</ul>
